# Images

OpenStack needs VM image(s) to spinup the VMs.

We use a tool called [Diskimage-builder](https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/) for building images for our OpenStack installation.

The scripts for the same are available at [aktech/nvidia-openstack-image](https://github.com/aktech/nvidia-openstack-image).
